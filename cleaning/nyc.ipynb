    "Data is from the New York Civil Liberties Union's [NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database](https://www.nyclu.org/en/campaigns/nypd-misconduct-database), obtained through FOIA requests by the NYCLU to NYC's Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), which is responsible for civilian oversight of the city's police.

    "Notes on the raw data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The earliest `ReceivedDate` (date on which the CCRB received the complaint) in the data is in January 1967 (though older data is less reliably recorded); the most recent is in February 2021\n",
    "- Each complaint (aka incident) is uniquely identified by `ComplaintID`\n",
    "- Each officer is uniquely identified by `OfficerID`\n",
    "- The data does not include pending complaints\n",
    "- The data includes only CCRB-investigated complaints made by civilians. CCRB's [jurisdiction](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/about/frequently-asked-questions-faq.page) covers four types of misconduct: force that is excessive or unnecessary; abuse of authority; discourtesy; and offensive language, collectively referred to as \"FADO\"\n",
    "- There can be more than one allegation under a given complaint. For example, an incident can have several allegations against multiple officers. Each allegation is uniquely identifed by `AllegationID`. An incident _can_ and often does contain more than one allegation against the same police officer (note this is where the NYC data differs from the Chicago data)\n",
